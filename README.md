## Task 02

This task implements a region-growing technique for image segmentation. The algorithm starts from seed points inside objects of interest and recursively adds neighboring pixels that fall within a predefined intensity range of the seed values.

#### ▶️ Key Concepts:

- **Seed Points**
Starting locations inside objects to begin region growth

- **Intensity Threshold**
Maximum allowed difference from seed pixel value

- **8-Connectivity**
Checks all 8 neighboring pixels (including diagonals)

- **Region Expansion**
Grows regions until no more similar pixels are found
